# DisplaySomeBlockchainInfoInRocket

Primary goal of this project is to further expand my knowledge of Rust.

After this project I want to be able to use https://crates.io/crates/rocket.
Data will be downloaded from some blockchain related API and displayed in web browser.
Async operations will be needed so Tokio is definitely going to be used.
